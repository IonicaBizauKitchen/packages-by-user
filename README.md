# packages-by-user

Compile an extensive JSON array of a given user's npm packages

As []@tobiaslabs](https://github.com/tobiaslabs/npm-owned-modules) aptly noted:

> Since npm doesn't publish any docs for interacting with their API, the best
you can do is read through their website repo and try to reverse engineer it.

This module is a simple command-line interfacing for dumping a user's entire
package repertoire into a big JSON file. Each package object in the resultant
array contains all the metadata provided by npm's skimdb registry.

## Usage


```sh
npm i -g packages-by-user
